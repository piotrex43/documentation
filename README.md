### The Community

We communicate using a [slack team](https://plugdj-extdevs.slack.com), if you would like to be added, please email
therealhenchman@gmail.com

The aim of this is to help developers in a clean way, with how the API works, so that minimal harm can come to the
service of plug.dj. It is here to explain how things work so that developers need not test and consume resources of the
service. 

We are here to encourage best practices. Every effort should be taken to protect the users of plug.dj. Information 
posted should never encourage abusing the API, harming users with the collection of data, or spamming and/or causing
the site any harm

### Rules For Contributing

* Please use the **staging** branch, this way they can be edited before they go live. Only hot fixes should hit the
master branch.

##### Content:

* Do not expose bugs, hacks or exploits! Make a ticket over at [support](https://support.plug.dj), so that they can be 
patched or fixed.
* Keep it clean, clear and relevant.
* If you spot wrong information, please submit an issue or a pull request correcting it. 
* If a method or an aspect of the API becomes deprecated, do not delete, but instead mark it as deprecated.

##### Style:

* Unordered lists **must** be in alphabetical order.
* Please spell check everything you write.
* Lines must not be more than 120 characters in length, this makes it easier to read in a text editor.
